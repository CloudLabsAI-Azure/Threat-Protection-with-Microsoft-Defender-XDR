# Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR solutions - Day 1

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore how to enhance organizational security using Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender XDR. You’ll configure foundational and advanced threat protection policies, simulate phishing and malware attacks using Attack Simulation Training, and analyze threats through Threat Explorer and real-time detections. You’ll also configure Anti-Phishing and Safe Links policies, create alert rules, implement and monitor secure posture settings using Configuration Analyzer and Microsoft Secure Score, and tag priority accounts. Finally, you’ll integrate Defender for Cloud Apps with Endpoint, enable Cloud Discovery, and analyze shadow IT using snapshot reports—equipping you with the skills to detect, respond to, and manage modern cyber threats across Microsoft 365 workloads.

## Objectives

- Configure standard and strict threat protection policies using Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
- Simulate phishing and malware attacks using Attack Simulation Training.
- Investigate email threats and user behavior through Threat Explorer and real-time detections.
- Create custom Anti-Phishing and Safe Links policies to defend against advanced threats.
- Set up alert policies to monitor malicious activities in email traffic.
- Enable and monitor secure posture features such as DKIM, Secure Score, and Priority Account Protection.
- Investigate and remediate incidents using Microsoft Defender XDR’s incident and alert workflows.
- Integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps with Endpoint for cloud app discovery.
- Generate and analyze snapshot reports to detect shadow IT and unsanctioned applications.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Familiarity with Microsoft 365 security and compliance capabilities.
- Understanding of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Cloud Apps.
- Access to the lab-provided Microsoft 365 tenant and administrative permissions.
- Basic knowledge of Conditional Access, SaaS onboarding, and security policy configuration.
- Awareness of Shadow IT risks, OAuth application security, and file governance.

## Explanation of Components

* **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: A cloud access security broker (CASB) that provides visibility, control, and protection for SaaS applications.
* **Cloud Discovery**: A feature that collects and analyzes app usage data to detect unsanctioned or high-risk apps in the organization.
* **Snapshot Reports**: Manually uploaded log files from firewalls or proxies that generate a one-time analysis of discovered apps.
* **Conditional Access App Control**: Integration with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to control and monitor sessions for connected cloud apps.
* **File Monitoring**: Capability to track file activity, classify sensitive content, and enforce data protection policies in connected apps.
* **Session Policies**: Real-time controls applied to user sessions, such as blocking downloads or restricting access based on device compliance.
* **App Governance**: Advanced monitoring for OAuth applications to detect risky permissions, unverified publishers, and unusual activity.
* **Detection Policies**: Custom rules to automatically identify and respond to high-risk behaviors or configurations in cloud apps.
