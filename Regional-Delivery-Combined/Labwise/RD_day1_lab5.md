   > **Standard protection** applies to all users with a baseline of spam, phishing, and malware protection.

   > **Strict protection** targets VIP or high-risk users with more aggressive detection rules and enhanced ML-based scanning.

   > If either toggle is **Off**, enable it to strengthen your Defender posture.

1. On the **Threat policies** page, scroll to **Templated policies** and click **Configuration analyzer**.
