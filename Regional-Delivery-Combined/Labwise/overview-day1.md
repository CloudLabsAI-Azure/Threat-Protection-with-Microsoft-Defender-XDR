# Hands-on Labs – Day 01

## Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR Solutions

### Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, and Microsoft Defender XDR to implement end-to-end protection against phishing, malware, and shadow IT risks. You will begin by enabling Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and configuring both Standard and Strict preset security policies for layered protection. You will then simulate phishing and malware attacks using the built-in Attack Simulation Training to evaluate user vulnerability.

Next, you will analyze threats using Threat Explorer and real-time detections, investigating user actions and simulation results. You will also create and validate custom Anti-Phishing and Safe Links policies, as well as configure alert rules for improved detection. Additionally, you will monitor your organization’s secure posture using Configuration Analyzer, DKIM validation, Priority Account protection, and Microsoft Secure Score. Finally, you will integrate Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps with Defender for Endpoint to discover shadow IT activity, analyze application risk levels, and enforce governance by marking unsanctioned applications.

## Objective

In **Day-1** of this workshop you will learn how to:

- Configure Threat Policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks using Attack Simulator
- Analyze Threats with Threat Explorer and Real-Time Detections
- Configure Anti-Phishing and Safe Links Policies
- Implement and Monitor Defender for Office 365 Secure Posture
- Investigate and Remediate Incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR
- Configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps – Cloud App Discovery
- Discover and Analyze Shadow IT using Cloud Discovery

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of Microsoft 365 and cloud security architecture.
- Familiarity with Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Defender XDR, and Defender for Cloud Apps portals.
- Experience with configuring security and compliance policies in Microsoft 365.
- Awareness of phishing, malware, and shadow IT threats.
- Access to the lab-provided Microsoft 365 tenant and test user accounts.

## Explanation of Components

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Provides advanced protection against phishing, malware, and targeted attacks across email, Teams, and collaboration workloads.
- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: A unified security platform that correlates signals across email, identity, endpoints, and cloud apps to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Capabilities in Microsoft Defender that assess and strengthen your organization’s cloud security posture.
- **Attack Simulation Training**: Built-in simulations that allow you to launch realistic phishing and malware scenarios to train and test users.
- **Threat Explorer and Real-Time Detections**: Tools for analyzing malicious emails, links, and attachments, providing visibility into user actions and potential compromises.
- **Anti-Phishing and Safe Links Policies**: Configurations that protect against impersonation, spoofing, and malicious URLs within email and collaboration tools.
- **Secure Posture Tools (Configuration Analyzer, DKIM, Secure Score)**: Features that monitor and improve organizational security baselines and email authentication.
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps**: A CASB solution that discovers, monitors, and controls cloud app usage, enabling governance of sanctioned and unsanctioned apps.
- **Cloud Discovery and Shadow IT Analysis**: Insights into cloud applications in use across your environment, helping detect risky or unapproved services.
