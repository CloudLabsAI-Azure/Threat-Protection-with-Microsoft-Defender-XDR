# Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR Solutions

Welcome to the **Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR** – Hands-On Lab Environment

This hands-on lab series is a three-day practical experience designed to help security analysts and operations teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats across Microsoft 365 using Defender XDR and Microsoft Sentinel.

### What to Expect in This Lab Space
Each day of the lab includes guided exercises aligned to core security operations themes. These labs offer real-world attack simulations, configuration tasks, and analytics-driven investigations to help you:

- Strengthen threat protection with Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- Investigate incidents and lateral movement using Microsoft Defender for Identity
- Analyze threats and automate detection using Microsoft Sentinel and hunting tools

You will perform hands-on tasks that simulate real-world security events—building the confidence and skills needed to defend your environment effectively.
