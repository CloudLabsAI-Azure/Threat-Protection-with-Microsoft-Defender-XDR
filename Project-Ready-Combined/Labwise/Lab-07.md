## Lab 7: Discover and Analyze Shadow IT Using Cloud Discovery

1. Analyze the report for the following options:

    - **Check the Summary Metrics:** Look at the total number of apps, users, IP addresses, and traffic volume to understand the overall cloud usage.
    
    - **Review App Categories**: Identify which categories (e.g., Cloud Computing, Storage, Collaboration) are using the most bandwidth and check if any unsanctioned apps are involved.
    
    - **Analyze Risk Levels**: Use the risk level chart to see how much traffic is coming from low, medium, or high-risk apps—focus on medium/high risk.
    
    - **Identify Top Users**: Check the “Top entities” section to see which users are generating the most traffic, especially to risky or unsanctioned apps.
    
    - **Inspect Discovered Apps**: Review the list of apps in use, their traffic volume, and verify if they are approved or need to be blocked or reviewed further.
