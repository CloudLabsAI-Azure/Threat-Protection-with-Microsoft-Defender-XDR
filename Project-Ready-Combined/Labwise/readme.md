# Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR solutions

### Overall Estimated Duration: 12 Hours

## Overview
This hands-on workshop provides practical experience in Microsoft Defender XDR, Defender for Office 365, and Defender for Cloud Apps. Participants will configure multi-layered threat protection policies, simulate phishing and malware attacks, analyze real-time threats, onboard and secure Microsoft 365 SaaS applications, and implement app governance for OAuth-based third-party apps. The labs also guide you through investigating and remediating security incidents, creating custom detection policies, and setting up proactive monitoring to strengthen security posture and maintain compliance.

## Objectives
- Configure and manage threat protection policies in Microsoft Defender XDR and Defender for Office 365.
- Simulate phishing and malware attacks and analyze threats using Threat Explorer and real-time detections.
- Investigate and remediate security incidents, configure anti-phishing and Safe Links policies, and manage security posture settings.
- Detect and analyze Shadow IT using Cloud Discovery in Defender for Cloud Apps.
- Onboard and protect Microsoft 365 SaaS applications, configure session and activity policies, and implement app governance for OAuth-based third-party apps.
- Enable and configure App Governance to monitor risky OAuth apps and create custom detection policies.
- Strengthen skills in incident response, policy management, and compliance using Microsoft’s integrated security solutions.
