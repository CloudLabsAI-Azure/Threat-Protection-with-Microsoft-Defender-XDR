# Hands-on Labs – Day 1

## Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR Solutions

### Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender XDR to implement layered threat protection against phishing, malware, and advanced attacks. You will begin by enabling Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and configuring both standard and strict preset security policies. You will then simulate phishing and malware attacks using the built-in Attack Simulation Training to assess user susceptibility and response. 

Next, you will analyze threats using Threat Explorer and real-time detections, reviewing user activity and simulation outcomes. You will also investigate and remediate incidents through automated investigation workflows and manual response actions. Finally, you will create and test custom Anti-Phishing and Safe Links policies, along with alert rules, to enhance ongoing email and link protection.

## Objectives

In **Day 1**, you will be able to:

- **Lab 1:** Configure Threat Policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365
- **Lab 2:** Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks Using Attack Simulator
- **Lab 3:** Analyze Threats with Threat Explorer and Real-Time Detections
- **Lab 4:** Investigate and Remediate Incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR
- **Lab 5:** Configure Anti-Phishing and Safe Links Policies

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of Microsoft 365 security architecture.
- Familiarity with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Defender XDR portals.
- Experience with configuring security policies in Microsoft 365.
- Awareness of phishing, malware, and email-based threat vectors.
