# Hands-on Labs – Day 1

# Implement Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender XDR

### Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender XDR to implement layered threat protection against phishing, malware, and advanced attacks. You will begin by enabling Microsoft Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and configuring both standard and strict preset security policies. You will then simulate phishing and malware attacks using the built-in Attack Simulation Training to assess user susceptibility and response. 

Next, you will analyze threats using Threat Explorer and real-time detections, reviewing user activity and simulation outcomes. You will also investigate and remediate incidents through automated investigation workflows and manual response actions. Finally, you will create and test custom Anti-Phishing and Safe Links policies, along with alert rules, to enhance ongoing email and link protection.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Enable and Configure Microsoft Defender CSPM**: Activate CSPM features and Defender plans to enhance posture management and visibility.
- **Apply Standard and Strict Preset Security Policies**: Protect specific recipients with multi-layered email security policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
- **Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks**: Launch credential harvesting and malicious attachment simulations to evaluate user behavior.
- **Analyze Threat Activity with Threat Explorer**: Investigate phishing simulation data, URL clicks, and malware activity in real-time.
- **Investigate and Remediate Security Incidents**: Use Microsoft Defender XDR to investigate incidents, take remediation actions, and initiate automated investigations.
- **Create Anti-Phishing and Safe Links Policies**: Configure targeted protection rules for phishing and malicious links, and create alert policies for detection events.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic understanding of Microsoft 365 security architecture.
- Familiarity with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Defender XDR portals.
- Experience with configuring security policies in Microsoft 365.
- Awareness of phishing, malware, and email-based threat vectors.
- Access to the lab-provided Microsoft 365 tenant and test user accounts.

## Explanation of Components

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: A cloud-based email filtering and threat protection service that safeguards against phishing, malware, and advanced attacks in Microsoft 365.
- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: An integrated security platform that correlates signals across email, identity, endpoints, and cloud apps to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: A set of tools and capabilities within Microsoft Defender to assess, monitor, and improve your organization’s cloud security posture.
- **Attack Simulation Training**: A Defender for Office 365 feature that allows security teams to run realistic phishing and malware attack scenarios to train and assess users.
- **Threat Explorer**: A real-time threat analysis tool that provides visibility into malicious emails, URLs, and attachments in your Microsoft 365 environment.
- **Anti-Phishing and Safe Links Policies**: Policy configurations that detect and block malicious senders, domains, and URLs, ensuring safe email and link handling.
