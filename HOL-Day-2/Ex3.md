# Exercise 3 ‚Äì Implement App Governance and Risk Detection for OAuth Apps [Read Only]

### Estimated Duration: 30‚Äì40 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will enable **App Governance** within Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and implement a detection policy that identifies OAuth apps with high-risk permissions. This helps security teams monitor third-party apps granted access to Microsoft 365 data and take proactive steps against potential threats from overprivileged or unverified applications.

App Governance extends Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps by giving insights into OAuth app behaviors, permission levels, publisher verification status, and risk scores.

---

## Lab Objectives

- Task 4: Review policy results and incidents

---

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 E5 license with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps enabled  
- At least one OAuth app registered and granted delegated permissions (e.g., AuditLogApp)

### Additional Notes

- **App Governance** works across Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and Salesforce OAuth apps.
- You can **integrate with Microsoft Sentinel** to stream incident alerts from App Governance.
- Apps like `AuditLogApp` with permissions such as `ActivityFeed.Read` or `ServiceHealth.Read` are considered **high privilege**.
