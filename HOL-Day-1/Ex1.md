# Exercise 1: Configuring Threat Policies and Simulating Attacks in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

## Overview

In this exercise, you will configure threat protection policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and use the Attack Simulator to mimic phishing and malware attacks. You will then explore how to analyze these simulated threats using Threat Explorer and real-time detections, gaining insights into how Defender identifies, tracks, and helps mitigate threats within your Office 365 environment.

## Objectives

- Task 1: Configure Threat Policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 
- Task 2: Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks Using Attack Simulator 
- Task 3: Analyze Threats with Threat Explorer and Real-Time Detections 

## Task 1: Configure Threat Policies in Microsoft Defender for Office 365

### Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), and search for **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

2. When prompted, click **Enable** to activate Defender CSPM.

3. Under **Defender plans**, turn on:

   - Foundational CSPM  
   - Defender CSPM  
   - Servers (under CWP)  

   Then click **Save**.

### Configure Threat Protection Policies

1. Open [Microsoft 365 Defender Portal](https://security.microsoft.com)

2. Navigate to:  
   **Email & collaboration** ‚Üí **Policies & rules** ‚Üí **Threat policies**

   ![](./media/gg-2-1.png)

---

### Apply Standard Protection Policies

1. Select **Standard Protection**, then click **Manage protection settings**.

2. In each section, choose **Specific recipients** and assign your lab user (e.g., `ODL_User@...`).

> üîê Standard protection includes Safe Attachments, Safe Links, and anti-phishing controls.

---

### Apply Strict Protection for High-Risk Users

1. On the protection profile page, go to **Strict Protection** and click **Manage protection settings**.

   ![](./media/gg-2-6-gg.png)

2. Like before, assign your lab user under **Specific recipients** for both Exchange and Defender for Office 365.

   ![](./media/gg-2-7.png)  
   ![](./media/gg-2-8.png)

3. Configure impersonation protection:

   - Add key email addresses to monitor  
   - Add domains (e.g., `www.officenced.com`) that need protection

   ![](./media/gg-2-3-1.png)  
   ![](./media/gg-2-3-2.png)

4. Complete the wizard and confirm the configuration.

---

### Confirm Policy Activation

1. Once setup is complete, verify that:

   - **Standard protection is on**  
   - **Strict protection is on** for selected users

   ![](./media/gg-2-11.png)

> ‚úÖ Your threat policies are now fully configured with layered protection for both general and high-risk users.


## Task 2: Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks Using Attack Simulator

## Task 2: Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks Using Attack Simulator

In this task, you'll simulate phishing and malware attacks using Microsoft Defender's built-in **Attack Simulation Training**. These simulations help you evaluate user vulnerability and response to social engineering techniques.

   **Email & collaboration** ‚Üí **Attack simulation training**

2. Click **Launch your own simulation**.

   ![](./media/gg-3-1.png)

3. Select **Launch a single simulation** and click **Continue**.

   ![](./media/gg-4-1.png)

4. On the **Select technique** screen, choose **Credential Harvest** and click **Next**.

   ![](./media/gg-4-2.png)

5. Name your simulation (e.g., `Test1`) and proceed.

   ![](./media/gg-4-3.png)

6. Select a payload such as **Expense report sharing**, then click **Next**.
