# Exercise 3: Implement and Monitor Secure Posture in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and XDR

## Overview

In this exercise, you will implement and monitor the secure posture of your Microsoft 365 environment using built-in features in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Microsoft Defender XDR. You'll start by reviewing and validating preset security policies, analyzing configuration gaps using the Configuration Analyzer, enabling DKIM and tagging priority accounts. Then, youâ€™ll simulate a phishing incident, investigate the email using Threat Explorer, take remediation actions, submit the message for analysis, and review the results of automated investigationsâ€”all from the Defender XDR portal.

## Objectives

- Task 1: Implement and Monitor Defender for Office 365 Secure Posture
- Task 2: Investigate and Remediate incidents in Microsoft Defender XDR

## Task 1: Implement and Monitor Defender for Office 365 Secure Posture

1. On the **Microsoft Defender portal**, select **Email & collaboration (1)** from the left navigation pane and then click on **Policies & rules (2)** under **Policies & rules**, click **Threat policies (3)**.

3. On the **Threat policies** page, under **Templated policies**, click on **Preset Security Policies**.
  
   ![](./media/rd_day1_ex3_t1_cor1.png)

1. Confirm that **Standard protection (1)** and **Strict protection (2)** are enabled. These policies enforce Safe Links, Safe Attachments, and tighter anti-phishing controls based on user risk levels.

   > **Standard protection** applies to all users with a baseline of spam, phishing, and malware protection.

   > **Strict protection** targets VIP or high-risk users with more aggressive detection rules and enhanced ML-based scanning.

   > If either toggle is **Off**, enable it to strengthen your Defender posture.

1. On the **Threat policies** page, scroll to **Templated policies** and click **Configuration analyzer**.

1. The **Configuration analyzer** provides recommendations under **Standard recommendations**. Note the counts for Anti-spam, Anti-phishing, DKIM, and Outlook misconfigurations.

1. Open Outlook or any other client and compose a test email addressed to a Gmail ID to verify DKIM.
  
   ![](./media/rd_day1_ex3_t1_7.png)

1. In Gmail, open the received test email, click the three dots in the top right corner, and select **Show original**.
  
   ![](./media/rd_day1_ex3_t1_8.png)

1. Under the **Original Message** view, confirm that **DKIM** shows as `'PASS'` for your domain.
  
    ![](./media/rd_day1_ex3_t1_9.png)

    > **Note**: DMARC validation may show as `'FAIL'` on `.onmicrosoft.com` domains. To enable full SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication, use a custom domain (e.g., `contoso.com`).

1. Back in the Defender portal, from the left menu, navigate to **System (1)** > **Settings (2)**, then select **Email & collaboration (3)**.
  
    ![](./media/rd_day1_ex3_t1_10.png)

1. On the settings page, click **Priority account protection (1)** and turn the toggle to **On (2)**.
