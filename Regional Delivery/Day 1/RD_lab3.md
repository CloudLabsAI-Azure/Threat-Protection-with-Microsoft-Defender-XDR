1. In the **Microsoft Defender portal**, do the following:

   - Select **Email & collaboration (1)** from the left navigation pane.
   - Click **Explorer (2)** under the Email section.
   - In the **URL clicks** tab, select the entry for the clicked timestamp.
   - Review the **URL (4)** that was clicked to investigate further.
