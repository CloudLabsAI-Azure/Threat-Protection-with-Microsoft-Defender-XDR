## Task 2: Simulate Phishing and Malware Attacks Using Attack Simulator

In this task, you'll simulate phishing and malware attacks using Microsoft Defender's built-in **Attack Simulation Training**. These simulations help you evaluate user vulnerability and response to social engineering techniques.

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

1. In the **Microsoft Defender portal**, select **Email & collaboration (1)**, click **Attack simulation training (2)**, and then click **Launch your own simulation (3)**.

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_15](./media/rd_day1_ex1_t2_15.png)

    > **Note:** Youâ€™ve successfully launched a phishing simulation. It will monitor how users interact with suspicious emails.

1. Under **Email & collaboration**, select **Attack simulation training** **(2)**. On the **Attack simulation training** page, select the **Simulations** tab **(3)**. Click **Launch a simulation** to begin creating a new attack simulation **(4)**.

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_16](./media/g_g_ex_1.png)

1. To simulate a **Malware Attack**, choose **Malware Attachment (1)**. Click **Next (2)**.

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_16](./media/rd_day1_ex1_t2_16.png)

1. Enter a new simulation name **`Test2`** and click **Next (2)**.

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_17](./media/rd_day1_ex1_t2_17.png)

1. Under **Payload selection**, choose a malware attachment like **HR notification on update of contract - English (2)** and click **Next (3)**.

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_18](./media/rd_day1_ex1_t2_18.png)

    ![rd_day1_ex1_t2_22](./media/rd_day1_ex1_t2_22.png)

> **Note:** This simulation mimics a malicious file being sent via email, testing how users respond to attachment-based threats.

> **Note:** The malware attack simulation will not appear in **Threat Explorer** because Microsoft Defender treats simulation payloads as non-malicious content. Simulated attacks are designed for training purposes and do not trigger standard detection engines or generate real threat signals within Explorer.
