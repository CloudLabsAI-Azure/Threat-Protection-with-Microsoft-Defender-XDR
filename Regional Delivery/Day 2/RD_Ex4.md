1. In the **Body** field, begin entering the incident metadata using the following format:
    ```
    Alert: Incident Title
    Severity: Incident Severity
    Status: Incident Status
    Entities: Entities
    Link: Incident URL
    ```
    Then insert each of the corresponding dynamic content values.<br>

   ![](./media/a_gg_ex4_7.png)
   > **Note:** Use dynamic fields to enrich the SOC email with full visibility into the incident.

1. Add **Incident Status** from dynamic content under **Status**.

   ![](./media/a_gg_ex4_9.png)

1. Add the **Entities** field next to the Entities label.

   ![](./media/a_gg_ex4_10.png)

     | where ProductName == "Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection"
     | where AlertSeverity != "Informational"
         or (AlertSeverity == "Informational" and DisplayName startswith "[Test Alert]")
     ```
   - Under **Alert enhancement**, set **Entity mapping (2)**:
     - Entity type: `Host`
     - Identifier: `HostName` â†’ `CompromisedEntity`

   ![](./media/crz_e4_g_3.png)

1. Scroll down to **Query scheduling**:

    - **Flagged by**: `From`
    - **Email Body**: `Body`
    - **Message ID**: `Internet Message Id`
    - **Flagged Date**: `Received Time`

   ![](./media/z_gg_e4_14.png)

   > **Note:** Use the dynamic content from **Get email (V2)** wherever possible for more complete data.  
   > **Important:** The **Body** field might store raw HTML â€” use additional processing if formatting is needed.

1. Once the flow is complete, click **Save** in the top-right corner.

   ![](./media/z_gg_e4_15.png)

1. Now go to your Outlook mailbox and flag an email you want to test the flow with.
