      >**Note:** Pasting into the virtual machine file might not show the full script length. Make sure the script matches the instructions within the *c2.ps1* file.

      ```PowerShell
      param(
        [string]$Domain = "microsoft.com",
        [string]$Subdomain = "subdomain",
        [string]$Sub2domain = "sub2domain",
        [string]$Sub3domain = "sub3domain",

        [int]$C2Interval = 8,
        [int]$C2Jitter = 20,
        [int]$RunTime = 240
    )
    $RunStart = Get-Date
    $RunEnd = $RunStart.addminutes($RunTime)
    $x2 = 1
    $x3 = 1 
    Do {
        $TimeNow = Get-Date
        Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Subdomain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
        if ($x2 -eq 3 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub2domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x2 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x2 = $x2 + 1
        }    
        if ($x3 -eq 7 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub3domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x3 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x3 = $x3 + 1
        }
        $Jitter = ((Get-Random -Minimum -$C2Jitter -Maximum $C2Jitter) / 100 + 1) +$C2Interval

      >**Note:** You will see DNS resolve errors. This is expected.

      >**Important**: Do not close these windows. Let this PowerShell script run in the background. The command needs to generate log entries for some hours. You can proceed to the next task and next exercises while this script runs. The data created by this task will be used in the Threat Hunting lab later. This process will not create substantial amounts of data or processing.

### Task 2: Persistence Attack Detection

In this task, you will create a detection for the first attack of the previous exercise.
1. In the Search bar of the Azure portal, type *Microsft Sentinel (1)*, then select **Microsoft Sentinel (2)**.

   ![](./media/09.png)
   
1. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier.

1. Select **Logs** from the *General* section.

    >**Note:** You might see some popup after clicking on **Logs**. close all Popups by clicking on **X** Icon.

1. **Run** the following statement with the *where* operator in our query to retrieve the results for the records that starts from particular EventId.

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where Activity startswith "4624" 
    ```
    ![Lab overview.](./media/Lab06-task02-query2.png)

1. It is important to help the Security Operations Center Analyst by providing as much context about the alert as you can. This includes projecting Entities for use in the investigation graph. **Run** the following query:

    ```KQL
    SecurityEvent 
    | where Activity startswith "4624" 
    | extend timestamp = TimeGenerated, HostCustomEntity = Computer, AccountCustomEntity = SubjectUserName
    ```

1. Now that you have a good detection rule, in the Logs window, select the **+ New alert rule** in the command bar and then select **Create Microsoft Sentinel alert**. This will create a new Scheduled rule.
   
    >**Hint:** You might need to select the ellipsis (...) button in the command bar.

1. This starts the "Analytics rule wizard". For the *General* tab type:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Name|Startup RegKey|
    |Description|Startup RegKey in c:\temp|
    |MITRE ATT&CK|Persistence|
    |Severity|High|

1. Select **Next: Set rule logic >** button.

1. On the *Set rule logic* tab, the *Rule query* should be populated already with your KQL query, under **Alert enhancement** expand *Entity mapping* and select **+ Add New Entity**.

    |Entity|Identifier|Data Field|
    |:----|:----|:----|
    |Account|FullName|AccountCustomEntity|
    |Host|Hostname|HostCustomEntity|

1. If **Hostname** isn't selected for *Host* Entity, select it from the drop-down list.

1. For *Query scheduling* set the following:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Run Query every|5 minutes|
    |Lookup data from the last|1 Days|

    >**Note:** We are purposely generating many incidents for the same data. This enables the Lab to use these alerts.

1. Leave the rest of the options with the defaults. Select **Next: Incident settings>** button.

1. For the *Incident settings* tab, leave the default values and select **Next: Automated response >** button.

1. On the *Automated response* tab, you will be able to see the Automation rule created in previous task. Leave everything as default and select  **Next: Review + Create** button.
  
1. On the *Review and create* tab, select the **Save** button to create the new Scheduled Analytics rule.

### Task 1: Investigate an incident

1. Select the **Incidents** page under Threat management from left side blade and Review the list of incidents

   ![](./media/7-1.png)

    >**Note:** The Analytics rules are generating alerts and incidents on the same specific log entry. Remember that this was done in the *Query scheduling* configuration to generate more alerts and incidents to be utilized in the lab.
  
1. Select one of the **Startup RegKey (1)** incidents. click on the **<< (2)** icon appear on the right side.Review the incident details on the right blade that opened. Scroll down and select the **View full details (3)** button.
